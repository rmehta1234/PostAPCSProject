Monopoly:
Stage 1: Proposal
A proposal for a project requires at least three students, with at least one student from each block! (This will require you to utilize GitHub and learn about branches, commits, and pulls.) The proposal must address each of the following:
•	  General description of the goal or purpose. What are you trying to make happen or solve? Feel free to design projects which utilize content from other courses (simulations, for example), address and analyze real daata and problems (the environment, anyone?), or have other useful impacts.
Monopoly board game. Multiplayer on the same computer, or game against bots. 
•	  Anticipated file structure (i.e. what classes will you write, where will the main method exist? Show me that you have thought enough about this problem or project to begin to recognize some of the complexity you will need to account for.
Player.java  hotels.java cards.java  board.java main method in monopoly.java
•	  New Java - your proposal/project must require you to utilize some new code structures. This could include learning how to read/write files into a JAVA program, rudimentary graphics, or some utilize some other class for your project.

	Graphic of the game board, which updates game pieces depending on player locations, when a player chooses to see the game board. 
•	  Division of labor: who will do what in this project? Is there enough required to justify the time and number of people? This will be the sole task which you will be engaged in during class time, but there is minimal expectation for work outside of class (unless you are not meeting your goals)
Some people will do graphics, some the actual game. There are many methods, many things to do that can be divided. (ex. making a list of game cards, like cards for hotels, railways community chest, chance cards, etc…)
